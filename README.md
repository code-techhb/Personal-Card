# My Student Personal Card 🌷

This repo contains a simple yet visually engaging portfolio-like page where you can learn more about me.
The page features an animated contact card that smoothly slides into the center when the website loads. It has a video background to make it more dynamic and interesting, along with an easy-to-recognize contact favicon.

## Features ✨

- **Animated Slide-in Card**: When you open the page, the contact card slides in smoothly, making the experience a bit more fun and interactive.
- **Video Background**: The background video features a beautiful view of my city, providing a personal touch and giving visitors a glimpse of where I'm from. The video plays until the screen size hits 512px, where it is replaced by a background image for better mobile performance.
- **Responsive Design**: Whether you're on a phone, tablet, or desktop, the site is designed to look great on all screen sizes without any need for scrolling on mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode**: Easily toggle between light and dark modes for a personalized viewing experience.

## Technologies Used 👩🏽‍💻

- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout, including animations, responsiveness, and background management.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features such as dark/light mode toggling and any user-triggered actions.
